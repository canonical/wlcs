wlcs (1.4.0-0ubuntu0) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release. Notable changes:
    + Add tests for zwp_text_input_unstable_v3
    + Add tests for zwp_input_method_unstable_v2
    + Add tests for zwlr_layer_shell_v1 version 4
    + Drop requriement for compositors to implement wl_shell. Tests which
      require an arbitrary "visible surface" should now only require one
      of xdg_shell, xdg_shell_unstable_v6, or wl_shell.
    + Fix expectations of keyboard focus for xdg_popup tests to match the
      protocol. NOTE: These tests will fail on many compositors, including
      Weston, as is is common to not follow the protocol correctly here.

wlcs (1.3.0-0ubuntu0) groovy; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release. Notable changes:
    + Check Cursor movement is not propagating to clients correctly when
    zwp_relative_pointer_manager_v1 is enabled
    + Support getting the latest serial sent from the compositor (useful for
    popup grabs, and possibly other things in the future). Adding `wl_keyboard`
    makes sure new surfaces have a serial once they're focused, and provides
    access to keyboard focus
    + Test that correct input event is used for interactive move
    + Fix FindGtestGmock.cmake for new cmake (Fixes the build on Alpine Linux)
    + Test that layer surfaces are correctly reconfigured
    + Add tests for popup done event
    + Test surfaces get enter/leave events
    + Test version 2 and 3 features of zwlr_layer_shell_v1
    + Destroy subsurfaces
    + Show surface type names in paramaterized touch tests

  * New upstream release. Notable changes:
    + Add tests for wlr_layer_shell_unstable_v1
    + Build fixes for Musl libc; WLCS now builds on Alpine. Thanks, Luca Weiss
    + More XDG Shell tests, particularly around protocol errors,
    window-geometry, and input edge-cases.
    + Add tests for wlr_foreign_toplevel_management_unstable_v1
    + Many improvements to wl_subsurface tests. Notably this fixes a
    misinterpretation of the protocol which lead to testing incorrect
    behaviour.
